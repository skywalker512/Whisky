# Build a 32-bit SDL2.dll for the bottle. OPTIONAL — see the measurement below.
#
# Steam's GPU probe, bin/gldriverquery.exe, is a 32-bit PE that imports SDL2.dll.
# Every package Steam downloads for a 64-bit install is *_win64 or *_all, so the
# 32-bit SDL2 is simply never delivered: the probe exits c0000135
# (STATUS_DLL_NOT_FOUND) before main(), and Steam records one opaque line —
#
#   Error: CFindCurrentBucketJob::YieldingRunTestProgram:
#          process exit code 3221225781: .\bin\gldriverquery.exe
#
# That log line is the ENTIRE effect of not having this DLL. Measured on
# 2026-08-07 by moving Steam/bin/SDL2.dll aside and launching from the Whisky
# GUI: the probe failed exactly as above (10:08:03 in logs/shader_log.txt, so
# the control was valid), and Steam logged in three seconds later
# (RecvMsgClientLogOnResponse ... processing complete, 10:08:06 in
# logs/connection_log.txt) and brought up its whole UI — main window 1280x800,
# Friends List, Special Offers, all onscreen. So this script is cosmetic: it
# removes one startup error and is a prerequisite for nothing. Do not treat a
# bottle without SDL2.dll as broken.
#
# It also has nothing to do with Steam's own UI, even though those windows have
# the Win32 class SDL_app: that class comes from Steam's own 64-bit SDL3.dll,
# which Steam ships and Steam.exe maps. No Steam process maps an SDL2 at all —
# only the separate 32-bit gldriverquery.exe loads the DLL built here.
#
# The 64-bit sibling gldriverquery64.exe does not import SDL2 and always ran.
#
# SDL2's ABI is stable across the 2.x series, so the exact release does not
# matter much; vendor/sdl2 is pinned at a release tag rather than a branch tip
# so a rebuild is reproducible.
