# Build ONLY the two sync-conformance test PEs used to validate the macOS msync
# fast-sync backend:
#
#   dlls/ntdll/tests/ntdll_test.exe      (dlls/ntdll/tests/sync.c   -> "sync" subtest)
#   dlls/kernel32/tests/kernel32_test.exe (dlls/kernel32/tests/sync.c -> "sync" subtest)
#
# msync (dlls/ntdll/unix/msync_*.c) is a *transparent* backend for the NT sync
# primitives (NtCreateEvent / NtWaitForMultipleObjects / mutexes / semaphores),
# so it has no dedicated tests — it is validated by running Wine's generic sync
# conformance tests under WINEMSYNC=1 vs WINEMSYNC=0. `scripts/test-msync.sh`
# does the running/diffing; this script just produces the PEs.
#
# The shipping build (scripts/build-proton-x86.sh) configures with
# --disable-tests, so the test dirs are in DISABLED_SUBDIRS and no
# *_test.exe rule exists in the build graph. This script RE-CONFIGURES the
# EXISTING, already-compiled build tree (vendor/proton-wine/build) WITHOUT
# --disable-tests, then builds just the two test targets. Because all of Wine
# is already compiled, `make dlls/ntdll/tests/all dlls/kernel32/tests/all`
# only links the two test PEs (fast) — it does NOT rebuild Wine and does NOT
# reinstall Libraries/Wine. The next `make proton` re-runs configure with
# --disable-tests, so this self-corrects (the shipping install is untouched
# either way — this script never runs `make install`).
#
# Env/toolchain (env -i clean room, CLEAN_PATH, X86_PREFIX, PKG_CONFIG_PATH,
# SDL2/LDFLAGS/CFLAGS, arch -x86_64) is the SAME as the shipping
# build-proton-x86.sh, MINUS --disable-tests. That shared block lives in
# wine_configure (lib/common.sh) so the two can never drift; the ONLY divergence
# is the extra flag (proton passes --disable-tests, this script passes none), and
# it never mutates the shipping build's tree — this script reuses build/ read-only
# apart from the reconfigure + linking the two test PEs, and never `make install`s.
