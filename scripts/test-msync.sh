# Validate the macOS msync fast-sync backend against Wine's generic NT-sync
# conformance tests. msync (dlls/ntdll/unix/msync_*.c) transparently backs the NT
# sync primitives, so it has no tests of its own — we run the ntdll/kernel32
# "sync" subtests under WINEMSYNC=1 (msync path) and WINEMSYNC=0 (wineserver
# baseline) and diff. A subtest that PASSES on the server baseline but FAILS
# under msync is a real msync conformance bug; a subtest that fails under BOTH
# is a pre-existing (non-msync) issue and is filtered out.
#
# Requires the test PEs built by scripts/build-msync-tests.sh.
#
# Usage: scripts/test-msync.sh [--guard-malloc] <bottle-dir>
#   <bottle-dir> is a bottle's WINEPREFIX directory, e.g.
#   ~/Library/Containers/com.isaacmarovitz.Whisky/Bottles/<UUID>
#
# --guard-malloc runs the test PEs under macOS Guard Malloc (libgmalloc) to
# catch heap use-after-free / overflow in msync's unix-side (libc) allocations
# — the memory-safety complement to the conformance diff. ASan won't run under
# Rosetta+Wine, but libgmalloc (a fat dylib with an x86_64 slice) DYLD_INSERTs
# into the translated wine process fine. It is much slower and RAM-hungry (a
# guard page per allocation), so it is opt-in.
#
# NOTE: these sync tests are partly timing-sensitive, so a run-to-run diff can
# carry a little flaky/timing noise on top of genuine failures — eyeball the
# per-test .diff files this prints paths to. todo_wine expectations are handled
# by the framework and do not count as failures.
