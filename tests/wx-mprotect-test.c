/*
 * wx-mprotect-test — does macOS let an executable mapping become writable, the
 * way Proton's steamclient trampoline setup assumes?
 *
 * ANSWER, measured on macOS 27 / Apple Silicon: YES, under Rosetta and
 * natively. This test exists to record a NEGATIVE result -- it was written to
 * confirm a W^X explanation for the Super Street Fighter IV fault, and it
 * refuted it instead. Do not re-derive that theory.
 *
 * Build: cc -O2 -arch x86_64 -o wx-mprotect-test wx-mprotect-test.c
 * Run:   arch -x86_64 ./wx-mprotect-test   (as Wine runs)
 *
 * dlls/ntdll/unix/loader.c:steamclient_setup_trampolines() does
 *
 *     mprotect(text, size, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE|PROT_EXEC);
 *
 * over steamclient.dll's .text and then writes jump stubs into it, redirecting
 * every export into lsteamclient. It does not check the return value, and this
 * tree has no MAP_JIT anywhere -- which made "macOS refuses W+X on a mapping
 * not created with MAP_JIT, the mprotect fails silently, and the jump stubs
 * then fault on a read-only page" a tidy explanation for SFIV's death
 * (EXC_BAD_ACCESS code=2 in memmove at an r-x PE code page, 100% CPU retry
 * loop). It is wrong: the mprotect below is granted.
 *
 * So whatever leaves that page r-x at the moment of the write, it is not the
 * kernel refusing W+X. Wine's own vprot bookkeeping resetting the protection,
 * or a write outside the range that was mprotect'd, remain open.
 *
 * Exit 0 when the measurement still matches what is recorded here (W+X
 * granted) and 1 if it ever changes, matching the 0-is-clean convention the
 * rest of tests/ uses. A nonzero exit here means the negative result above no
 * longer holds and the SFIV notes that lean on it need re-reading.
