/*
 * msync-msgloop-hang-test — assert a window's message pump keeps answering
 * while both of its wake sources are driven at once under msync.
 *
 * What this is for: Steam's "Special Offers" window cannot be closed. WM_CLOSE
 * is ignored, SendMessageTimeout(hwnd, WM_NULL) times out — so it is not a
 * handler declining to close, it is a dead pump — and `sample` shows the thread
 * that owns the window (CrBrowserMain) parked in msync_wait_single(). With the
 * bottle's enhanced sync set to none (WINEMSYNC=0) the same window closes
 * normally, so the fault is in msync, not in winemac or the window system.
 *
 * Why the test looks like this. The thing under test is a Chromium UI thread:
 * it blocks in MsgWaitForMultipleObjects over a set of events PLUS the message
 * queue, and drains with PeekMessage when the queue wakes it. Two wait shapes
 * matter and they take different code paths, so both are run here:
 *
 *     0 events  queue only     -> ONE object   -> msync_wait_single/__ulock_wait2
 *     N events  events + queue -> multi-object -> mach semaphore + registration
 *
 * The stuck Steam thread is on the first. Worker threads then drive both wake
 * sources at once (SetEvent and PostMessage), because a wake lost between the
 * two is the interleaving being hunted.
 *
 * Two details are load-bearing, and getting either wrong makes the test unable
 * to fail for the right reason:
 *
 *   - The pump waits INFINITE. With a finite timeout it wakes itself on expiry,
 *     a lost wakeup degrades from a hang into mere latency, and the probe can no
 *     longer see the thing it exists to find.
 *   - The detector is SendMessageTimeout(WM_NULL, SMTO_ABORTIFHUNG) from another
 *     thread — the exact call that fails against the real Steam window. A pump
 *     that is running answers WM_NULL immediately; a parked one cannot answer at
 *     all. Counting dispatched messages would not distinguish "slow" from "dead".
 *
 * Note the WINEMSYNC_NO_* gates cannot be used to narrow this down: switching an
 * object class to the server routes the whole wait into msync_wait_mixed_any(),
 * a polling loop, which cannot hang however broken the object is. Any gate would
 * look equally exculpatory. Use WINE_MRING=1 instead — it names the object a
 * parked thread is on and whether that object is already signaled.
 *
 * Build:
 *   x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -O2 -o msync-msgloop-hang-test.exe msync-msgloop-hang-test.c
 * Run:
 *   wine64 msync-msgloop-hang-test.exe [seconds-per-case]   # exit 0 = pass
 *
 *   A failure here is only evidence about msync if the same run passes on the
 *   wineserver oracle, so confirm with:
 *       WINEMSYNC=0 wine64 msync-msgloop-hang-test.exe
 *   A stall under BOTH is a bug in this test or a loaded machine.
 *
 *   WINE_MRING=1 arms the in-tree wait-path tracer (patches/proton-wine/0010),
 *   which writes /tmp/mring_<pid>.log while this runs.
