# WINEMSYNC_NO_ANON_AUTOEVENT was set in Wine.swift and in three scripts for
# months. Nothing ever read it: msync_obj.c gates on _NO_EVENT, _NO_AUTOEVENT,
# _NO_MANUALEVENT, _NO_SEMAPHORE and _NO_MUTEX, and there is no anon/named
# distinction to gate on. Setting it was harmless; believing in it was not —
# test-msync.sh and run-msync-close-test.sh unset it to build their "full msync"
# arm, so both arms were the same configuration and every comparison that rested
# on the distinction measured nothing.
#
# A misspelled or invented variable is silent in every other way: no warning at
# launch, no error at runtime, and the behaviour it was supposed to select just
# never happens. This is the only place it shows up.
#
# Run: tests/env-contract-test.sh      # exit 0 = every variable has a reader
