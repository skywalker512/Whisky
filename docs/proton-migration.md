# Proton migration — Valve Proton_11.0 on Apple Silicon (Rosetta 2)

Goal: replace Whisky's x86_64 Wine 11.13 with **Valve's `proton-wine` 11.0** so Proton
inherits all of Whisky's macOS capabilities — msync fast-sync, DXMT (D3D11/10/DXGI),
KosmicKrisp Vulkan, DXVK (D3D9), Steam webhelper CEF flags, CoreAudio
virtual-device hiding, `WINE_NX_COMPAT` — while keeping D3D9/10/11 all working. Motivation:
Proton ships Valve's game fixes, media-converter, `amd_ags`, fsync, and a maintained
tree that plain WineHQ 11.13 lacks.

## Status (Proton is the shipped, single backend; Steam logs in fully under msync)
- Proton is laid **directly over** `Libraries/Wine` — the single shipped backend. The
  `WineBackend` enum and the side-by-side `Libraries/WineProton` plumbing that existed
  during bring-up are gone; legacy Whisky-Wine 11.13 (`vendor/wine`) is removed entirely.
- Built x86_64, runs under Rosetta 2; DXMT installed on top of the Proton build.
  Reports `wine-11.0`.
- **Steam logs in fully.** With the minimal-msync config Steam boots → CEF webhelper →
  full CM logon: `RecvMsgClientLogOnResponse : 'OK'` + JWT, real SteamID, login window
  interactive, zero `OBJECT_TYPE_MISMATCH`. The launch config is:
  `WINEMSYNC_NO_MANUALEVENT=1` (manual-reset events → server-sync, everything else on
  msync — this is what fixed the full-msync spin, see "Steam on Proton"),
  `PROTON_DISABLE_LSTEAMCLIENT=1`,
  Follow-System-Proxy OFF, and msync-only (no eventfd on macOS, so WINEESYNC is unset).
  (`WINEMSYNC=1` is **not** set — `do_msync()` defaults msync ON, so it was dropped as
  redundant; only the `.none` sync mode sets `WINEMSYNC=0`.)
- Source tree `vendor/proton-wine/` is **gitignored**, tag `proton-wine-11.0-…`. Tracked
  in main: `patches/proton-wine/` (**22-patch series**, base `c3007e6f` on Valve's
  `bleeding-edge`) + `scripts/build-proton-x86.sh`
  (`make proton` — the single Wine build; configures, builds, installs to `Libraries/Wine`);
  `scripts/build-dxmt.sh` defaults `DXMT_WINE_BUILD` to `vendor/proton-wine/build`.
- **App wiring**: single backend, no selector. `BottleSettings` has no `WineBackend`;
  `Wine.wineBinary(for:)`/`binFolder(for:)` resolve to `WhiskyWineInstaller.binFolder`
  (`Libraries/Wine/bin`). `PROTON_DISABLE_LSTEAMCLIENT=1` is wired into `Wine.swift`.
  `BottleWineConfig.enhancedSync` defaults to `.msync`; a legacy `.esync` bottle is
  decode-migrated to `.msync`.

## The msync startup crash (root cause)
Proton's `wineserver` crashed immediately at bottle init (0 files landed in
`system32`). Diagnosed with **live lldb** — dead Rosetta core dumps only carry ARM64
*host* registers and never expose guest x86_64 frames, so post-mortem cores were
useless; attaching live to the running guest was the only way to see the faulting
frame.

- Fault: `server/event.c` `req_event_op` tripped
  `assert(event->sync->ops == &event_sync_ops)` with a garbage `event->sync`.
- Cause: with `do_msync()` active, `get_event_obj` returns an `msync`-backed object
  cast as `struct event`. `req_event_op` then reads `event->sync`, but that field sits
  at a different offset in `struct msync` → garbage pointer. Only reached when the
  **client** actually sends an `event_op` request.
- Deeper cause: the msync port in `dlls/ntdll/unix/sync.c` had dropped the
  `if (do_msync()) return msync_reset_event/pulse_event(...)` guards from
  `NtResetEvent`/`NtPulseEvent`, and `NtSetEvent` had all three code paths wrongly
  piled together, so the client fell through to the server `event_op` path against an
  msync object.
- Fix (in patch `0008`): each `Nt*Event` guards its server fallback with
  `if (do_msync()) return msync_*`; also added the missing msync branch to
  `NtWaitForSingleObject` (only `NtWaitForMultipleObjects` had it).

## patches/proton-wine/ — 22-patch series
Base: **`c3007e6f`** on Valve's `bleeding-edge` — the only branch Valve still pushes to
(see the header comment in `scripts/build-proton-x86.sh`, which is the source of truth).

Disjoint file ownership; all apply cleanly (`git apply --check`). Exported as
`git format-patch` style `.patch` files. Groups: `0001`–`0006` build/portability
(`0007` **dropped** → gap), `0008` the single consolidated msync patch, `0009` + `0011`–`0013`
macOS capability ports, `0010` the temporary msync MRING wait-path tracer,
`0014`–`0015` Steam-runtime deadlock fixes, `0016` msync
abandoned-mutex on last-handle-close, `0017` D3D/Vulkan builtin load-order default,
`0018` ws2_32 prefix hosts-file lookup, `0019` ws2_32 IPv4-only `getaddrinfo`
(`WINE_DISABLE_IPV6`), `0020` kernelbase appends `--no-sandbox` to
`steamwebhelper.exe` (retires the IFEO wrapper — see `docs/steam-webhelper.md`),
`0021` ws2_32 `WSALookupServiceBegin` half-stub, `0022` server clears stale
`AFD_POLL_CONNECT_ERR` on socket reuse (backport of upstream `864ca426`, Wine 11.14),
`0023` winemac snaps a borderless work-area-origin fullscreen window.

### Editing the series — `scripts/proton-branch.sh`
The `.patch` files stay the source of truth for a fresh clone, since `vendor/proton-wine`
is gitignored. But editing them by hand does not scale: `0008` **creates** its files
(`--- /dev/null`), so touching one means rewriting a whole new-file section, and moving a
hunk between patches means reproducing by hand the state each patch sees.

`proton-branch.sh init` replays the series as one commit per patch file on branch
`whisky/patches`, off tag `whisky/base`. Edit and commit there — `git commit --fixup=<sha>`
plus `git rebase --autosquash whisky/base` puts a hunk in the right patch — then
`proton-branch.sh export` writes the commits back. An `X-Patch-File:` trailer on each
commit preserves the filenames. Round trip is exact: applying the exported series onto
`whisky/base` reproduces the branch tip's tree hash.

Two things to know. `apply_patches()` in `scripts/lib/common.sh` **applies nothing** when
the tree is on `whisky/patches` — the series is already there as commits, and its
per-patch reverse-check could not work anyway once `0010` edits files `0008` creates. And
most patches carry no `From:` line; `git am` takes the author from the mail rather than
falling back to the config, so `init` synthesises one from the repo config.

### 0001–0006 — build / portability (make Proton compile + boot on macOS; 0007 dropped)
- `0001-macos-de-linux-ntdll` — guard Linux-only futex/CPU paths in
  `signal_x86_64.c`/`system.c`/`fsync.c`; `set_thread_teb` a no-op on Apple (the
  dispatcher owns `%gs`/pthread TSD; raw TEB write → SIGBUS). Trimmed so `sync.c`/
  `loader.c` de-linux hunks live in `0008`.
- `0002-winedmo-ffmpeg8-pcm-bsf` — drop reliance on FFmpeg-internal BSF plumbing for
  PCM byte-order reversal (winedmo builds against our x86_64 FFmpeg 8).
- `0003-win32u-opengl-compile-without-libegl` — compile framebuffer-surface / fs_hack
  path without libEGL.
- `0004-media-converter-pthread-include-macos` — `#include <pthread.h>` for
  `pthread_mutex_t` in winegstreamer media-converter.
- `0005-amd_ags_x64-guard-libdrm-non-linux` — guard libdrm/amdgpu use behind `__linux__`.
- `0006-loader64-wine64-macos` — build a 64-bit `wine64` loader on macOS
  (`loader64/Makefile.in`).
- `0007-rundll32-remove-ws-visible-wineboot-hang` — **DROPPED 2026-07-24 (obsolete).**
  Verified `wineboot --init` completes rc=0 in ~16s on a fresh prefix with upstream
  `WS_VISIBLE` (twice); the winemac deadlock is gone in proton-wine 11.0. Leaves a gap
  at 0007.

### 0008 — msync (single consolidated patch)
- `0008-macos-msync` — the big one (**~55 files, ONE patch**, incl. regenerated protocol
  files so a fresh apply needs no `make_requests`). All msync work lives here:
  - CrossOver macOS fast-sync (msync) core across `dlls/ntdll/unix/*` and `server/*`;
  - the boot-crash dispatch-guard fix above (`do_msync()` on `NtResetEvent`/`NtPulseEvent`/
    `NtWaitForSingleObject` — else the client hits the server `event_op` path against an
    msync object and wineserver asserts) plus the `req_event_op`/`query_event` handlers
    branching on `obj.ops==&msync_ops`;
  - `do_msync()` honoring `WINEMSYNC` (was hardcoded on);
  - the `mach_msg2` → libSystem `mach_msg()` Rosetta wrapper (the raw `mach_msg2_trap`
    is invoked through an untranslated pointer under Rosetta and crashes);
  - the **mixed-wait hybrid** `msync_wait_mixed_any` + per-object msync idx for waits
    (formerly the standalone `0014` refinement — see "Mixed waits" below);
  - msg-queue wake consistency (formerly a standalone patch);
  - the **socket-async / system-APC lost-wake fix** (`msync_run_system_apcs()` drains
    system APCs on the SIGUSR1/EINTR interrupt so socket async completions deliver — the
    fix that made Steam log in);
  - (**removed 2026-08-06, `e01790ad`** — was: an experimental `WINEMSYNC_UNIFIED`
    event-driven mixed-wait bridge. Opt-in via an env var nothing in the tree ever set,
    so it was unreachable; it also leaked subscriptions on thread death and could hand a
    recycled bridge shm index's subscriptions to a new thread. Deleted along with the
    unreachable inproc_sync msync backing and the `MSYNCSPIN`/`INNERSPIN`/`WAITDUMP`
    debug instrumentation — ~570 lines total, no behavior change. msync runs on the
    classic per-object shm path and always did);
  - **four NT-sync conformance fixes** (formerly standalone `0016`/`0017` in two rounds,
    now all folded into `0008` to keep the client msync sources single-owner): mutex
    `NtReleaseMutant` previous-count (`*prev = 1 - mutex->count`); msync/fsync alertable
    `NtDelayExecution` returning `STATUS_TIMEOUT` instead of `STATUS_SUCCESS`; wait fast-path
    now enforces `SYNCHRONIZE` on the object (records the granted access mask per cached
    handle, denies a wait that lacks it — clears kernel32:sync test:300 + cascade test:330);
    `NtPulseEvent` falls through to the wineserver for handles that don't resolve to an
    msync event, so a keyed event yields `STATUS_OBJECT_TYPE_MISMATCH` not
    `STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED` (clears ntdll:sync test:338).

#### Layout: five files, not one `msync.c`
`0008` creates the client backend as `dlls/ntdll/unix/`:

| file | what it owns |
|---|---|
| `msync_private.h` | payload structs, the offset asserts, type predicates, the readiness primitives |
| `msync_shm.c` | shm mapping, the mach semaphore pool, `do_msync`, `msync_init` |
| `msync_obj.c` | the object cache, `create_msync`, typed getters, the `Nt*` entry points |
| `msync_wait.c` | wait registration, `msync_wait_single`, `msync_wait_multiple` |
| `msync_select.c` | the mixed msync/server wait strategies and `msync_wait_any`/`_all` |

Three invariants hold the backend together, and each is now stated once:

- **Readiness lives at offset 0** of every payload — `semaphore.count`, `event.signaled`,
  `mutex.tid` — because `__ulock_wait2()` compares against the word the pointer names.
  `C_ASSERT`s in the header enforce it. Everything that asks "is this ready?" goes through
  `msync_ready()`, and everything that parks goes through `msync_wait_value()`; the mutex's
  odd cases (free `0`, abandoned `~0`, recursively held by us) are encoded in those two
  and nowhere else. On this side, at least — `server/msync.c`'s registration TOCTTOU
  re-check is a second encoding, deliberately, since it runs in the other process.
- **Type checks are inseparable from payload access.** `get_semaphore_object()` /
  `get_mutex_object()` / `get_event_object()` return the typed payload or
  `STATUS_OBJECT_TYPE_MISMATCH`; there is no way to reach `obj->shm` without having
  proved the type. Asserting accessors were tried and dropped: re-reading `obj->type`
  after the caller already branched on it opens a window where a concurrent close and
  handle reuse turns a returnable status into an `abort()`.
- **The semaphore pool never shrinks.** `->total` is a high-water mark into a *fixed*
  array — alloc hands out `&semaphores[total]` and increments — so decrementing it frees
  nothing and instead re-points the next alloc at a slot still in use. `semaphore_create()`
  then overwrites that slot's port name under a live waiter, and because the waiter
  re-reads `*sem` at `semaphore_wait()` — *after* `server_register_wait()` already gave the
  wineserver the old port — the wake goes to the old port and the waiter never returns.
  A permanent hang in the multi-object path, which is what `MsgWaitForMultipleObjects`
  uses. Ports are bounded at 1024; not shrinking is cheap.

Also in `0008`: `msync_wait_mixed_all()`, which replaced a `FIXME` that silently skipped
every server object (a wait-all over an event plus a named pipe returned `SUCCESS` with the
pipe unsignaled). It takes the msync side first, since that side can be rolled back with
`msync_ungrab()`, then the server side as one zero-timeout `SELECT_WAIT_ALL`; the
inter-round sleep deliberately passes **no** handles, because a `SELECT_WAIT` there would
consume a server object it could not give back. And four missing `msync_close()` hooks
alongside the existing `close_inproc_sync()` calls (`DUPLICATE_CLOSE_SOURCE`,
`get_apc_result`, `suspend_thread`, `get_thread_context`).

### Validating msync (conformance harness)
msync is a *transparent* backend for the NT sync primitives, so it has no tests of its own.
`scripts/test-msync.sh` runs Wine's `ntdll:sync` + `kernel32:sync` subtests under
`WINEMSYNC=1` (fast path) vs `WINEMSYNC=0` (wineserver baseline) and diffs them — a subtest
that passes on the baseline but fails under msync is a real msync bug; one that fails under
both is a pre-existing non-msync issue and is filtered out. `--guard-malloc` reruns under
macOS libgmalloc to catch heap corruption in msync's unix-side allocations. The test PEs are
built by `scripts/build-msync-tests.sh` (re-configures the already-compiled
`vendor/proton-wine/build` *without* `--disable-tests` and links just the two `*_test.exe` —
never runs `make install`, so the shipping build is untouched). This harness drove the msync
conformance work above: msync-only failures went **6 → 2**.
- kernel32:sync test:393/397 **abandoned-mutex** — msync tracked mutex ownership
  client-side only, so the object was freed at last handle-close before the owner thread's
  `TerminateThread` could run `msync_abandon_mutexes`. Fixed by `0016`, which keeps the
  shm slot alive server-side while an owner still holds the mutex.

  Current state of the harness: **ntdll 0 failures on both arms; kernel32 1 on both**, so
  no msync-only failure remains. A run is only meaningful if both arms produce a non-empty
  log — a wineserver left over from a previous run makes msync init fail, and a 0-byte log
  reads as "zero failures".

### 0009–0013 — macOS capability ports
- `0009-macos-dxmt-winemac-support` — the winemac side DXMT needs: a Metal view for an
  HWND. **Rewritten 2026-08-06** (`fc088f9e` → `845bd4d4` → `77a47e98`); the old shape
  described here — a `macdrv_functions` table plus a struct mimicking DXMT's 8.16-era
  copy of `macdrv_win_data` — is **gone**. Current shape:
  - two **scalar** exports, `macdrv_dxmt_create_metal_view(hwnd, device, *view, *layer)`
    and `macdrv_dxmt_release_metal_view(view)`. Every field of the old table and struct
    was pointer-sized, so a rename or reorder on either side compiled clean on both and
    then called the wrong function pointer. Scalars have no layout to keep in step.
    The DXMT side is `patches/dxmt/0005-winemetal-scalar-metal-view-entry-point.patch`
    (additive — the old dlsym path stays as a fallback for 3Shain's fork).
  - the view comes from `macdrv_client_surface_create()` (what winemac's own Vulkan
    driver uses for MoltenVK), registered with win32u via `add_window_client_surface()`,
    which the patch moves from `win32u_private.h` to `include/wine/gdi_driver.h` so a
    driver can call it. Wine then owns repositioning (`update_client_surfaces`) and
    teardown (`detach_client_surfaces`); the returned handle is the surface, so its
    refcount is the whole lifetime rule.
  - **the bug this fixed:** the old code hand-rolled a view with `macdrv_create_view()`
    and only attached it when `data->cocoa_window` was set — true for a toplevel, never
    for a child HWND. DXMT reads a NULL view as a broken Wine, logs *"your Wine has no
    exported symbols needed by DXMT"* and `abort()`s. Browsers (Chromium/CEF, Qt
    WebEngine) composite into child HWNDs, games do not — which is why only browsers
    died, black window then gone. Covered by `tests/dxmt-child-swapchain-test.c`.
  - still pairs with the **`RTLD_GLOBAL` dlopen for `winemac.so` only** in
    `dlls/ntdll/unix/loader.c` (not every unixlib — that would put all their
    default-visibility symbols in one namespace).
  - a `scripts/check-dxmt-abi.sh` guard existed briefly (`21adee60`) to police the
    struct ABI and was **deleted the same night** (`2744d49a`): with scalar arguments
    there is nothing to police. It does not exist; ignore any reference to it.
- `0023-macos-snap-borderless-fullscreen-window` — `rcWork` and `rcMonitor` share an
  origin on Windows (taskbar at the bottom) but not on macOS (menu bar at the top);
  measured in a bottle: `rcMonitor 0,0 1470x956` vs `rcWork 0,33 1470x923`. An app that
  asks for the work-area origin while sizing to the full monitor (Unity `-popupwindow`
  and friends) therefore lands one menu-bar height too low. Snaps exactly that case —
  borderless, display-sized, top edge aligned to that display's work area — and forces
  the frame-changed event so Wine's rects follow. Titled windows are left alone: AppKit's
  `constrainFrameRect:toScreen:` pins their top a couple of points below the work area
  (a titled window asked for `0,33` or `0,0` both land at `0,35`), and Wine reporting
  that faithfully is correct, not something to fight. `tests/window-snap-test.c`.
- `0010-macos-msync-mring-tracer` — **temporary.** A lock-free ring recording which msync
  objects each thread is about to block on, snapshotted to `/tmp/mring_<pid>.log` by a
  background thread; `WINE_MRING=1` arms it. It exists because `fprintf`-based tracing
  perturbs the lost wakeup it is meant to catch — the TRACE path's latency reorders a
  sub-microsecond race out of existence — so the hot path costs one atomic fetch-add and
  a few plain stores. Kept out of `0008` so it can be dropped in one move.
  (The number previously held `macos-kernelbase-ifeo-debugger`, deleted when `0020`
  retired the Steam webhelper wrapper that was its only consumer, along with
  `Steam.configure`'s per-bottle IFEO cleanup.)
- `0011-macos-nx-compat-env` — `WINE_NX_COMPAT` env var to force DEP on legacy images
  (fixes DXMT Tahoe slowness).
- `0012-macos-coreaudio-hide-virtual-devices` — hide virtual audio devices from games
  (`winecoreaudio.drv` + `mmdevapi`) — fixes device enum-loop hangs.
- `0013-macos-server-fsync-delinux` — de-linux the `server/fsync.c` stubs for the macOS
  build.

Provenance — these were ported from the now-removed Whisky-Wine `patches/wine/` set:
`0009`≈old `0002`+`0005`+`0006` (macdrv export + Metal view position + borderless
fullscreen-snap) — the fullscreen-snap has since been **split out into `0023`**, so
`0009` is now the Metal-view entry points only; old `0010`≈`0003` (removed; the number
was later reused for the MRING tracer), `0011`≈`0004`,
`0012`≈`0007`. The old rundll32
WS_VISIBLE patch was obsolete (dropped above). `0008`/`0013` (msync + fsync) and
`0001`–`0006` are Proton-specific (WineHQ 11.13 already had msync-free sync and none of
Proton's extra unixlibs).

### Mixed waits (folded into 0008)
msync (like esync) cannot natively wait on a set mixing fast msync objects
(events/mutexes/semaphores) with pure-server objects (named pipes, async I/O, completion
ports). Upstream just logs a FIXME and waits on the msync objects only → deadlock
whenever a server object is the waker (RpcSs startup, wine-mono MSI, cold-boot service
handshake, Steam's `reg add`). fsync escapes this via in-proc-sync fds the server can
wait on; msync has no server-side shadow. Fix (now in `0008`): `msync_wait_mixed_any()`
polls — grab any ready msync object in userspace, and between checks do a short bounded
`server_wait()` on just the server subset (`objs[i]==NULL` marks a server object). Only
mixed waits (RPC/service, never a game hot path) take this path. Hardened per review:
propagate real `server_wait` errors instead of busy-looping on non-`STATUS_TIMEOUT`; back
the poll interval off 2 ms → 16 ms when idle; NULL-guard `msync_apc_addr`. **This poll is
the only mixed-wait mechanism.** An event-driven `WINEMSYNC_UNIFIED` bridge and a "uniform
inproc_sync shadows" rework were both tried as alternatives and are both **gone** (see the
removal note under `0008` above); inproc_sync is structurally wrong for macOS, where an
msync object is pure shm + `__ulock` with no fd for the server to wait on.

### 0014–0015 — Steam-runtime deadlock fixes (all found live under Steam)
Both are **PE** dlls built for BOTH arches (`dlls/{combase,ntdll}/{i386,x86_64}-windows/*.dll`
→ `Wine/lib/wine/{i386,x86_64}-windows/`) because **steam.exe is 32-bit**.
- `0014-combase-rpcss-cold-start-race` — `dlls/combase/rpc.c`. COM out-of-proc activation
  binds `ncalrpc:[irpcss]`; on a cold boot steam.exe races ahead and connects to the
  `\\.\pipe\lrpc\irpcss` endpoint ~tens-of-ms before rpcss creates it →
  `RPC_S_SERVER_UNAVAILABLE`, and `start_rpcss()`'s retry gave up because
  `OpenService("RpcSs")` also fails in the same cold window → uncaught → crash. Fix:
  make SCM/StartService best-effort and **`WaitNamedPipe`** on the irpcss endpoint pipe
  (bounded 30 s) before returning success. Root cause is startup ordering (`OpenService`
  failing during cold boot), not "Rosetta slowness" per se; the pipe path is derived from
  `IRPCSS_ENDPOINT` so it can't drift.
- `0015-ntdll-fls-callback-no-lock` — `dlls/ntdll/thread.c`. `RtlFlsFree` and
  `RtlProcessFlsData` invoked the per-index FLS destructor callback **while holding the
  global `fls_section`**. A Steam thread-exit callback that blocks on another thread which
  itself needs `fls_section` (FlsAlloc/Free, or its own exit cleanup) deadlocks — one
  thread sits 60 s in `RtlpWaitForCriticalSection("fls_section ... blocked by <tid>")` and
  the client never starts. Windows runs FLS callbacks with no internal lock held; upstream
  Wine keeps the lock and only survives the process-**exit** variant (its
  `fls_exit_deadlock` test) via the shutdown path — it does *not* prevent our
  startup/handoff inversion, which msync + Rosetta timing hits every launch. Fix: clear
  each data slot *before* the callback (so a rescan / concurrent teardown never
  double-calls), drop `fls_section` around the callback, re-acquire and `goto restart`.
  This is a genuine upstream Wine bug, not Proton- or msync-specific.

## Steam on Proton — launch investigation
**Resolved 2026-07-24: Steam logs in fully.** Order of bugs hit and fixed to get there:
1. **Proton lsteamclient tier0 crash** — the "reinstall Steam" box was Proton's
   lsteamclient redirect stranding `steamclient64`'s tier0 imports (`g_pMemAllocSteam`)
   on ntdll stubs. Fixed with `PROTON_DISABLE_LSTEAMCLIENT=1` (wired into `Wine.swift`).
   Proton-only bug, not upstream Wine.
2. **msync mixed-wait deadlock** (now folded into `0008`) — blocked wine-mono MSI,
   cold-boot service handshake (left `syswow64` empty), and Steam's `reg add`.
3. **combase/rpcss cold-start race** (`0014`) — steam.exe crashed ~seconds in with an
   uncaught `RPC_S_SERVER_UNAVAILABLE` during COM activation.
4. **FLS-callback deadlock** (`0015`) — bootstrap→client handoff hung 60 s on
   `fls_section`, then Steam self-terminated, orphaning the webhelper child process.
5. **msync socket-async / system-APC lost-wake** (now in `0008`) — the last blocker.
   Socket async completions were not delivering under msync; `msync_run_system_apcs()`
   drains system APCs on the SIGUSR1/EINTR interrupt. **This is the fix that made Steam
   log in.**

After all of the above, with msync enabled (the default; no `WINEMSYNC=1` needed) Steam
completes a full CM logon (`RecvMsgClientLogOnResponse : 'OK'` + JWT, real SteamID,
interactive login window, zero `OBJECT_TYPE_MISMATCH`).

**The full-msync CPU spin — localized and fixed (`a54abb92`).** steam.exe pinned a core
inside `msync_wait_multiple` on a rapidly set/reset **MANUAL** event (type 3), not an
auto-reset one — so no auto-event lever could ever have stopped it.
Reproduced and bisected with `scripts/msync-manualevent-spin-test.c`: plain msync burns
~13.6 CPU-s / 12.6M wakeups, `WINEMSYNC_NO_MANUALEVENT=1` drops it to ~6.2 CPU-s / 0.6M —
identical to the `WINEMSYNC=0` server baseline, and `scripts/test-msync.sh` shows no new
msync-only failures. `Wine.swift` sets it, and it is now the only `WINEMSYNC_*` variable
Whisky sets; coarser lever if it ever regresses is
`WINEMSYNC_NO_EVENT=1` (all events → server). An inner-loop bounded-spin/`usleep` backoff
on `STATUS_PENDING` was tried and **reverted** — the cost is a wake storm (real
`STATUS_SUCCESS` returns), so a per-`STATUS_PENDING` backoff never fires; routing is the
right layer, not a fast-path code patch.

Note the spin was blamed for the invisible Steam login window; that turned out to be an
unrelated DXMT/winemac bug (see `0009` above and `docs/steam-webhelper.md` §0). The spin
was real and the fix is real, but it was not that bug's cause.

**msync enablement scope + gating code** (all in `dlls/ntdll/unix/msync_obj.c`, code is the
source of truth):
- **Global switch — `do_msync()`.** On macOS msync defaults **ON** (`WINEMSYNC` unset ⇒ 1);
  `WINEMSYNC=0` forces it off (debug/fallback to the slower wineserver sync). It is the
  `__ulock`/mach-semaphore fast path.
- **Per-type scope.** Every type is now gateable: events via `event_uses_msync(type)`,
  semaphores via `use_msync_semaphore()`, mutexes via `use_msync_mutex()`. When a gate
  returns 0 the `Nt*` wrapper returns `STATUS_NOT_IMPLEMENTED` and falls through to the
  wineserver path (same as server-only objects — no msync/server casting). All default
  **on**; semaphores and mutexes are the game hot path and should stay on.
- **Bisection levers** (env, inherited so a named object resolves to the same type in
  every process). The full set that `dlls/ntdll/unix/msync_obj.c` actually reads is:
  `WINEMSYNC_NO_EVENT` (all events → server), `WINEMSYNC_NO_AUTOEVENT`,
  `WINEMSYNC_NO_MANUALEVENT`, `WINEMSYNC_NO_SEMAPHORE`, `WINEMSYNC_NO_MUTEX`.
  `event_uses_msync()` takes only the type — there is **no** anon/named distinction.
  `NO_MANUALEVENT` is the one that fixed the spin; the rest are for bisecting.

**It is NOT a network / VPN / winsock problem** (verified during the investigation):
- Steam downloads its update manifest directly (`client-update.steamstatic.com`,
  "Verification complete") with no VPN.
- China-channel CMs (`ISteamDirectory/GetCMList?cellid=47` → `103.28.54.x:27017`) are
  **directly reachable** from the host (`nc` succeeds).
- The user's geph runs in **proxy mode** (SOCKS `9909` / HTTP `9910`, no `utun`), so it
  neither transparently routes Steam's raw CM traffic nor is needed for it.

**App-launch gotchas:**
- **Follow System Proxy OFF.** Follow System Proxy injects the geph HTTP proxy
  (`http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:9910`) because geph registers a macOS system proxy; that
  HTTP proxy **breaks Steam's CM** (WSS → 403) and the CM is directly reachable anyway.
  (The bottle's internal `ProxyEnable` registry is separate; keep both off.)
- **msync-only (no eventfd on macOS → esync can't exist).** Resolved: nothing on the
  stack reads WINEESYNC (no `esync.c` in the wine tree; DXMT doesn't read it — verified
  by binary scan). msync defaults ON in `do_msync()`, so `BottleSettings` sets **no**
  `WINEMSYNC` at all for the default `.msync` mode (only `.none` sets `WINEMSYNC=0`), and
  leaves WINEESYNC unset (the env dict fully replaces the parent, so unset ≡ 0). (There is no "DXMT esync-detection
  lie" — that was a myth; no such `lid3dshared.dylib` exists.)
- **`PROTON_DISABLE_LSTEAMCLIENT=1`** (wired into `Wine.swift`).
- The Steam webhelper wrapper is applied automatically on launch — from the GUI or via
  `whisky run`, both through `Wine.prepareForLaunch` → `Steam.configure`.

## scripts/build-proton-x86.sh (was install-proton.sh + build-wine-x86.sh)
`make proton` runs `scripts/build-proton-x86.sh`, the single Proton build: it resets
`vendor/proton-wine` tracked source to HEAD, (reverse-check-)applies
`patches/proton-wine/*`, configures + builds x86_64 (WoW64), then installs into
`Libraries/Wine` — the single shipped backend. Install steps:
- `make install DESTDIR=` into a tmp tree under `arch -x86_64`, drop `.a` import libs
  and `share/man`, PE-strip in release (`WHISKY_WINE_BUILD=debug` keeps debug info),
  copy `bin`/`lib`/`share`.
- Bundle x86_64 dylibs (freetype, sdl2, molten-vk, gnutls, gettext, our
  `vendor/ffmpeg-x86` libs), materializing brew link-farm symlinks.
- **KosmicKrisp loader swap**: install the Khronos Vulkan loader as BOTH
  `Wine/lib/libMoltenVK.dylib` and `Wine/lib/libvulkan.1.dylib`; drop the ICD manifest
  to `~/.local/share/vulkan/icd.d/`.
- **DXMT restore over wined3d**: `make install` writes Wine's builtin `d3d11.dll`
  (wined3d — FL 9_3 → GLES2 only), clobbering any prior DXMT install. The script
  restores the DXMT Metal builds (d3d11/d3d10core/dxgi/winemetal, x86_64 + i386)
  over them so `make proton` is order-independent — skipped when DXMT artifacts
  are absent (run `make dxmt`). Mirrors the KosmicKrisp swap; see
  `docs/steam-webhelper.md` for why the webhelper needs DXMT (GLES3 /
  SharedImageStub).
- `install_name_tool -add_rpath '@loader_path/../..'` on every `x86_64-unix/*.so`.
- Append `[Drivers] Graphics=mac` to `share/wine/wine.inf`; symlink `wine64 → wine`;
  write `WhiskyWineVersion.plist`.

(The old `install-proton.sh` — which assumed a pre-built tree and had an
`INSTALL_TO_WHISKY=1` side-by-side `Libraries/WineProton` option — was folded into
`build-proton-x86.sh` and removed. Proton now installs straight over `Libraries/Wine`.)

## DXMT against Proton — scripts/build-dxmt.sh parameterization
`build-dxmt.sh` reads two env vars, both **defaulting to the Proton build** (the
shipped backend):
- `DXMT_WINE_BUILD` — Wine build tree for headers (default `vendor/proton-wine/build`).
- `DXMT_WINE_LIB` — install target (default `…/Libraries/Wine/lib/wine`).

The defaults are correct for the normal `make dxmt`; override only to build DXMT
against a *different* Wine tree:
```
DXMT_WINE_BUILD=<other>/build \
DXMT_WINE_LIB=<OtherInstall>/Wine/lib/wine \
scripts/build-dxmt.sh
```
Everything else (LLVM 15 pin, zstd link fix, win64+win32 PE dlls, `winemetal.so`
unixlib) is unchanged.

## Mono
Proton hardcodes `wine-mono-10.4.1` (`MONO_VERSION` in
`dlls/appwiz.cpl/addons.c`). Decision: **do not build wine-mono from source** — let
Wine install it at runtime. The `.msi` is fetched to Wine's own cache (`~/.cache/wine/`)
through the system proxy (`dl.winehq.org` is blocked directly on some networks, reachable via
`127.0.0.1:9910`) so `wineboot` installs it silently.
